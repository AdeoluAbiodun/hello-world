About Myself:
I aspire to become a Full Stack Engineer while currently holding the position of lead data analyst in a Fortune 500 company in New York. With over 7 years of experience as a Data Analyst, I aim to bring a strong blend of analytical skills, problem-solving expertise, and technical versatility to the realms of both front-end and back-end engineering.
